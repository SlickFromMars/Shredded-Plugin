# Shredded - A Blender Plugin

A passion project to make useful tools for blender, that I'm making public.

## Geometry Clipboard

A way to copy the raw pydata of a mesh's geometry, to be reconstrutced anywhere. The data is compressed small enough to send without Nitro! Sweet!

## Node Presets

Premade nodes for your shaders, with many more coming soon!

## Preset Meshes

Add various models instantly. Why would you need them? I have no idea. But they're there.

## More to come!

There are TONS of planned features. If you wanna get in on the development, make a pull request. We need all the help we can get.
